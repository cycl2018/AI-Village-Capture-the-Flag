Scenario
A ML model has been built to detect a 0-day. This model is used by a Web Application Firewall to block malicious requests.

Objective
The goal of the challenge is to discover what the 0-day is by what it is blocking, and then bypass the WAF to exploit the system.

PS: The WAF assesses malicious strings in 5 characters blocks.

# Submission Helper

import base64

## input = base64.b64encode(b"This was a test of your emergency systems").decode()
input = "mFzaC=="
data = json.dumps(
    {"input": input}
)

try:
    r = requests.post("https://waf.fly.dev/score", data=data)
    print(r.text)
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    print("Connection problems. Contact the CTF organizers.")
